# Shiny Bot

A Python bot based off of the [`discord.py 1.3.4` project](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/) (this is the current stable release of the project as of time of writing this)
.
## Requirements
1. An [application and bot setup for Discord](https://discord.com/developers/). You'll need the token for it.
<!-- 1. A mysql database with login information to log into a db.
1. A redis database for the user system. -> currently used. -->
1. Python 3.7+ installed

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo into the place you want to run it from.
1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill it in with the required values.
1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all of the required dependancies.
1. Run the main script: `python3 ./bot`.

If you want to overwrite any of the default values (like `MYSQL_PORT`) in `.env` then copy the line and paste it in to your `.env.local` file.
